        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        <!-- Making use of what's called 'caps drop' where the first letter is considerably larger than the rest of text. -->
        <p>
          At the fine age of six, Li-Ming started following lessons for the
          recorder to develop the usefull skill of reading notes. After about
          1.5 years he decided to switch to the piano. Following the example of
          his older sister Minke who'd been playing the piano for a couple years
          as well as singing. Li-Ming followed his lessons locally at 'Het
          KunstKwartier' in Helmond, The Netherlands. For about 10 years he'd
          had the same teach: Paul Chatrou who tought him almost everything he
          knows, with love and passion. Mr. Chatrou introduced Li-Ming to many
          genres especially classical caught his eye. After learning his first
          classical piece Für Elise, Li-Ming's passion for music was fully
          egnited. Now engulfing himself in Chopin's Nocturnes he has found more
          motivation than ever before. Mr. Chatrou stopped teaching after many
          many years and decided to focus on his other passion, composing piano
          music. Now Mrs. Marjola Lishi has taken Li-Ming under her wing for him
          to reach new unknown heights.
